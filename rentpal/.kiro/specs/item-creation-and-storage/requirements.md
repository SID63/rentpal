# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the item creation functionality in the rental marketplace application. Users are currently unable to successfully create items due to form submission failures, and the application lacks proper Supabase storage bucket configuration for handling item images and profile pictures. This feature will ensure reliable item creation and establish a robust image storage system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Item Creation Form Submission

**User Story:** As a rental marketplace user, I want to successfully create new rental items through the web form, so that I can list my items for rent and start earning income.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user fills out the item creation form with valid data THEN the system SHALL successfully create the item in the database
2. WHEN the form submission encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages to the user
3. WHEN a user attempts to create an item without a complete profile THEN the system SHALL guide them to complete their profile setup
4. WHEN the item creation is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the item details page or items list
5. IF the user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission and display an authentication error

### Requirement 2: Configure Supabase Storage Buckets

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want properly configured Supabase storage buckets for images, so that users can upload and manage item photos and profile pictures securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the storage system is configured THEN the system SHALL have separate buckets for item images and profile avatars
2. WHEN a bucket is created THEN it SHALL have appropriate security policies for public read access and authenticated write access
3. WHEN storage buckets are configured THEN they SHALL support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
4. WHEN buckets are created THEN they SHALL have reasonable file size limits to prevent abuse
5. IF a bucket already exists THEN the system SHALL not attempt to recreate it

### Requirement 3: Item Image Upload Integration

**User Story:** As a rental marketplace user, I want to upload multiple images for my rental items, so that potential renters can see detailed photos of what they're renting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads images during item creation THEN the system SHALL store them in the designated item images bucket
2. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL associate them with the correct item in the database
3. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL validate file type and size before processing
4. WHEN image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages about the failure
5. WHEN an item is created with images THEN the system SHALL ensure all images are properly linked to the item

### Requirement 4: Profile Image Upload Integration

**User Story:** As a rental marketplace user, I want to upload a profile picture, so that other users can identify me and build trust in the marketplace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a profile image THEN the system SHALL store it in the designated avatars bucket
2. WHEN a profile image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL update the user's profile record with the image URL
3. WHEN a user changes their profile image THEN the system SHALL remove the old image from storage
4. WHEN profile image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
5. IF a user doesn't have a profile image THEN the system SHALL display a default avatar

### Requirement 5: Storage Management and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic cleanup of unused images, so that storage costs remain manageable and the system doesn't accumulate orphaned files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an item is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated images from storage
2. WHEN a user changes their profile image THEN the system SHALL delete the previous image
3. WHEN image upload is interrupted THEN the system SHALL clean up any partially uploaded files
4. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors for administrative review
5. IF an image is referenced by multiple records THEN the system SHALL only delete it when no references remain
