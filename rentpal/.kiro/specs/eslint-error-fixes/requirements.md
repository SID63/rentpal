# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the systematic resolution of ESLint errors and warnings throughout the RentPal codebase. The project currently has numerous linting issues including unescaped entities, unused variables, missing dependencies in React hooks, TypeScript any types, and parsing errors that need to be resolved to maintain code quality and prevent potential runtime issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint errors to be resolved, so that the codebase maintains high quality standards and prevents potential runtime issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL return with exit code 0 (no errors)
2. WHEN ESLint encounters unescaped entities THEN the system SHALL properly escape all HTML entities using appropriate React escape sequences
3. WHEN ESLint detects parsing errors THEN the system SHALL fix all syntax errors in TypeScript and JavaScript files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused variables and imports to be cleaned up, so that the codebase is lean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint detects unused variables THEN the system SHALL remove all unused variable declarations
2. WHEN ESLint detects unused imports THEN the system SHALL remove all unused import statements
3. WHEN variables are used only in specific contexts THEN the system SHALL prefix them with underscore if they need to remain for interface compliance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React Hook dependency warnings to be resolved, so that components behave predictably and avoid stale closure issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect hooks have missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL add all required dependencies to the dependency array
2. WHEN useCallback hooks have missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL add all required dependencies to the dependency array
3. WHEN dependencies would cause infinite re-renders THEN the system SHALL implement proper memoization or restructure the code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript `any` types to be replaced with proper types, so that the codebase maintains type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint detects explicit `any` types THEN the system SHALL replace them with appropriate specific types
2. WHEN function parameters use `any` THEN the system SHALL define proper interfaces or union types
3. WHEN event handlers use `any` THEN the system SHALL use proper React event types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all image optimization warnings to be addressed, so that the application has better performance and follows Next.js best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint detects `<img>` tags THEN the system SHALL replace them with Next.js `<Image>` components where appropriate
2. WHEN images need alt attributes THEN the system SHALL add meaningful alt text or empty strings for decorative images
3. WHEN images are used in components THEN the system SHALL implement proper loading and error handling
