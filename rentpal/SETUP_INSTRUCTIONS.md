# RentPal Setup Instructions

## Current Status: ✅ Code Complete, ⚠️ Needs Supabase Configuration

The authentication system is fully implemented but requires real Supabase credentials to function.

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up
2. Create a new project named "rentpal"
3. Wait for project initialization (~2 minutes)

### 2. Get Credentials
In your Supabase dashboard:
- Go to **Settings** → **API**
- Copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Replace these values in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here
```

### 4. Set Up Database Schema
In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** and run the complete schema:

1. Copy the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` from the project
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click "Run" to execute the schema

This will create:
- All necessary tables (profiles, items, bookings, categories, etc.)
- Row Level Security policies for data protection
- Database functions and triggers for automation
- Indexes for optimal performance
- Custom types and constraints

### 4.1 Set Up Seed Data (Optional)
After running the schema, you can also run the seed data:

1. Copy the contents of `supabase/seed.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor  
3. Click "Run" to populate initial categories

This adds 8 main categories with 32+ subcategories for the rental marketplace.

### 5. Set Up Storage Buckets
In Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage** and create these buckets:

1. **avatars** (public) - for user profile pictures
2. **item-images** (public) - for rental item photos

The storage policies are automatically created by the schema, so no additional SQL is needed.

### 6. Configure Email Settings (Optional)
For email verification to work:
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Configure your email provider (or use Supabase's built-in email for testing)

## Testing the Application

Once configured, you can test:

1. **Registration Flow**:
   - Go to `/auth/register`
   - Create an account
   - Check email for verification link
   - Complete profile setup

2. **Login Flow**:
   - Go to `/auth/login`
   - Sign in with your credentials
   - Access the dashboard

3. **Profile Management**:
   - Edit your profile at `/profile/edit`
   - Upload a profile picture
   - Update your information

## Current Error Explanation

The "Failed to fetch" error you're seeing is because:
- The app is trying to connect to `https://placeholder.supabase.co`
- This is not a real Supabase URL
- Once you update with real credentials, the error will resolve

## What's Already Implemented ✅
